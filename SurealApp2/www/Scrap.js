He is well known for his electronic music, veganism, and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.[2] AllMusic considers him \\\"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\\\".[3]\\n\\nMoby gained attention in the early 1990s with his electronic dance music work, which experimented in the techno and breakbeat hardcore genres. With his fifth studio album, the electronica and house music-influenced Play, he gained international success. Originally released in mid-1999, the album sold 6,000 copies in its first week, and it re-entered the charts in early 2000 and became an unexpected hit, producing eight singles and selling over 10 million copies worldwide.[4] Moby followed the album in 2002 with 18, which was also successful, selling over 5 million copies worldwide and receiving mostly positive reviews, though some criticized it for being too similar to Play.\\n\\nHis next major release, 2005's mostly upbeat Hotel was a stylistic departure, incorporating more alternative rock elements than previous albums,[citation needed] and received mixed reviews. It sold around 2 million copies worldwide. After 2008's dance-influenced[citation needed] Last Night (2008), he returned to the downtempo electronica of Play and 18 with 2009's mostly-ambient Wait for Me,[citation needed] finding higher critical acclaim and moderate sales, as well as 2011's Destroyed. Moby's latest album, Innocents, was released on October 1, 2013.\\n\\nMoby has also co-written, produced, and remixed music for Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Daft Punk, Mylène Farmer, Brian Eno, Pet Shop Boys, Britney Spears, New Order, Public Enemy, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Soundgarden, and others.\",\"genres\":[1,2,3,4],\"artists\":[],\"bands\":[],\"socialData\":{\"Facebook\":false,\"Twitter\":false,\"Googleplus\":false,\"Microsoft\":false}}"}],"revenue_share":{"items":[]},"songs":{"items":[{"id":2167,"title":"1-01 Prologue.m4a","track_id":"","song_info":"{\"type\":\"audio/x-m4a\",\"size\":4.5311679840087891,\"duration\":\"1:56\",\"artists\":{\"items\":[]}}","metadata_json":"\"\"","created_by_id":1357,"updated_by_id":1357,"created_on":"2016-05-11T08:02:14.51","updated_on":"2016-05-11T08:02:14.51","datamode":"A"}]},

In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\\\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States. Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling him the King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 172 million albums, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications).\\n\\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with his The Slim Shady LP, which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in US sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide—the second time he had the international best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\\n\\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\\"Lose Yourself\\\", the first rap artist to win the award.[3] Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009), The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage.\",\"genres\":[],\"artists\":[],\"bands\":[],\"socialData\":{\"Facebook\":false,\"Twitter\":true,\"Googleplus\":false,\"Microsoft\":true}}"},{"id":225,"name":"GArt","accountuser_id":217,"private_profile_json":"{\"name\":\"GArt\",\"gender\":\"Male\",\"dob\":\"12121985\",\"tagline\":\"I am an Artist\",\"location\":\"\",\"cover_photo\":\"https://surealmusicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/b93b9e06-a6a2-4aa2-8acb-bdff10a46ba3-.jpg\",\"profile_photo\":[{\"id\":\"p1\",\"photo\":\"https://surealmusicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/89825d91-4c40-483b-962d-2461d3dd42b3-.jpg\",\"photo_extension\":\"jpg\",\"selected\":true},{\"id\":\"p2\",\"photo\":\"\",\"photo_extension\":\"\",\"selected\":false},{\"id\":\"p3\",\"photo\":\"\",\"photo_extension\":\"\",\"selected\":false}],\"bio_photo\":[{\"id\":\"p1\",\"photo\":\"https://surealmusicstorage.blob.core.windows.net/images/89825d91-4c40-483b-962d-2461d3dd42b3-.jpg\",\"photo_extension\":\"jpg\",\"selected\":true},{\"id\":\"p2\",\"photo\":\"\",\"photo_extension\":\"\",\"selected\":false},{\"id\":\"p3\",\"photo\":\"\",\"photo_extension\":\"\",\"selected\":false}],\"fb_link\":\"\",\"twitter_link\":\"\",\"googleplus_link\":\"\",\"microsoft_link\":\"\",\"aboutyou\":\"I am an Artist\",\"genres\":[1,9,11,16],\"artists\":[],\"bands\":[],\"socialData\":{\"Facebook\":false,\"Twitter\":true,\"Googleplus\":false,\"Microsoft\":false}}"}],
